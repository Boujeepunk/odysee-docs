# Balances

When viewing your wallet, you'll notice a few different balances.

On the right, you'll have a balance in USD or Euros if you've received any cash tips that haven't cashed out yet. These cash out automatically to your connected bank account.

On the left, your total Credits balance is all of the Credits in your possession.

Your immediately spendable balance is exactly that, your Credits that can be spent immediately.

- Credits received from others are tips that have been sent to you. Until unlocked, these will boost the visibility of the content they were tipped on. To learn more, check out our guide on staking [here](https://help.odysee.tv/category/staking).
- Credits staked on initial publishes are what was staked when originally uploading the file. This can be made available by editing the deposit amount on the upload, or deleting the upload.
- Credits supporting content is Credits that is currently boosting other creators' content.
