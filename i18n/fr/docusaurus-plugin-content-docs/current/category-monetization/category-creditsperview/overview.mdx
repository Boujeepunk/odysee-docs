# Overview

Receiving Credits per view on Odysee gives creators Credits for each verified view. A verified view is a view from a verified user. This means that we have verified that you are a real person and thus avoid abuse. In addition to preventing abuse, creators will only monetize the first 7 views from a verified user each day.

## How much do I receive per view?

To check your Credits per view, navigate to the channels page by clicking the profile picture icon and selecting **Channels** in the drop down menu.
